# Depi-Pipeline - CI/CD Pipeline

This README file contains a Description for Jenkins pipeline that automates the process of building, analyzing, and deploying microservices. The pipeline is designed to handle multiple services in parallel, ensuring a smooth and efficient CI/CD workflow for the **Depi** project.

## Pipeline Overview

This pipeline integrates with Jenkins and uses the following key technologies:
- **Git** for version control.
- **SonarQube** for static code analysis and quality gate checks.
- **Docker** for building and managing microservices.
- **Slack** for post-build notifications.

The pipeline is configured to build a set of microservices in parallel, ensuring faster execution times. Each microservice is built as a Docker container, pushed to a Docker registry, and cleaned up afterward to optimize disk space.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Git Checkout
In the first stage, the pipeline checks out the latest version of the code from the Git repository. This ensures that the pipeline always works on the most up-to-date code.

- **Branch**: The pipeline fetches code from the `karim` branch.
- **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/karim-mohamedd/Depi.git`

```groovy
git branch: 'karim', url: 'https://github.com/karim-mohamedd/Depi.git'
```

### 2. Code Analysis (SonarQube)
The pipeline integrates with **SonarQube** to perform static analysis on the codebase. This step ensures that the code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes quality gate checks.

- **Scanner**: The `sonar-scanner` tool is used to perform the analysis.
- **Project Key**: `Depi-Pipeline`
- **Project Name**: `Depi-Pipeline`

```groovy
withSonarQubeEnv('sonar') {
    sh '''
        $SCANNER/bin/sonar-scanner \
        -Dsonar.projectKey=Depi-Pipeline \
        -Dsonar.projectName=Depi-Pipeline \
        -Dsonar.java.binaries=.
    '''
}
```

### 3. Build Services
In this stage, multiple microservices are built in parallel. Each microservice is built as a Docker image and pushed to the Docker registry. The services are as follows:

- **AdService**
- **CartService**
- **CheckoutService**
- **CurrencyService**
- **EmailService**
- **Frontend**
- **LoadGenerator**
- **PaymentService**
- **ProductCatalogService**
- **RecommendationService**
- **ShippingService**
- **ShoppingAssistantService**

For each service:
- **Docker Build**: The microservice is built using a `Dockerfile`.
- **Docker Push**: The built image is pushed to a Docker registry.
- **Docker Cleanup**: The local Docker image is removed after the push to save space.

Example for **AdService**:
```groovy
withDockerRegistry(credentialsId: 'docker-cred', toolName: 'Docker') {
    sh '''
        docker build -t devilcontainer/adservice:latest /var/jenkins_home/workspace/Depi-Pipeline/src/adservice
        docker push devilcontainer/adservice:latest
        docker rmi -f devilcontainer/adservice:latest
    '''
}
```

This process is repeated for all services in parallel, significantly reducing the overall build time.

### 4. Post-Build Notifications
After the build process completes, the pipeline sends a notification to a Slack channel, informing the team of the build's success or failure.

- **On Success**: A success message is sent to the Slack channel.
- **On Failure**: A failure message is sent with a link to the build for further investigation.

```groovy
post {
    success {
        slackSend(channel: 'jenkins', message: "Build succeeded! Everything is ok: ${env.JOB_NAME} #${env.BUILD_NUMBER}")
    }
    failure {
        slackSend(channel: 'jenkins', message: "Build failed! Check the error: ${env.JOB_NAME} #${env.BUILD_NUMBER}")
    }
    always {
        echo 'This will always run, regardless of success or failure.'
    }
}
```

## Pre-requisites
Before using this pipeline, ensure that the following tools are set up and configured:
- **Jenkins**: The Jenkins server must be installed and running.
- **SonarQube**: The SonarQube server should be available for static code analysis.
- **Docker**: Docker must be installed on the Jenkins server for building and pushing images.
- **Slack**: A Slack webhook should be configured to receive notifications.

## Configuration

### Jenkins Configuration
- **SonarQube**: Configure the SonarQube instance in Jenkins.
- **Docker Credentials**: Store the Docker registry credentials under the ID `docker-cred`.
- **Slack Webhook**: Set up the Slack integration and configure the channel to receive notifications.

### Environment Variables
- **SCANNER**: This environment variable is used to define the path to the SonarQube scanner.

```groovy
environment {
    SCANNER = tool 'sonar-scanner'
}
```
